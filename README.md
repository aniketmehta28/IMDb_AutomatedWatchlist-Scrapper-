# IMDb_AutomatedWatchlist-Scrapper
This is a project I made as a part of my submission in a hackathon organised by Pepcoding. It basically used puppeteer libraries to log in to IMDb,scraps some data from the List Of Best Picture Winners since the Oscars Started, and also adds them to the watchlist in our IMDb account.



Package Installation:
npm i name of package(down below)




Packages Used : 

Puppeteer : https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer

Require: https://www.npmjs.com/package/require
 
Cheerio:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio

json2xls:https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2xls




Possible Errors:

1.id and password (by the variables id and pw) are to be filled in the form of a string, for which an IMDb account is required. Hence if you don't have one then the code won't work.

2.Recuuring Error: On multiple testings, there were times when the Excel Data that was being scrapped would be half of its ecpected size.
